# CS 230 Portfolio – Operating Platforms

Welcome to my CS 230 portfolio!  
This repository contains my coursework and projects from the CS 230 Operating Platforms class.

---

## About This Course
CS 230 focuses on understanding operating systems, system architectures, memory and storage management, and distributed systems. Throughout the course, I have completed assignments, labs, and projects to strengthen my skills in analyzing and designing software for different operating platforms.

---

## Repository Contents
- **Assignments:** Exercises and tasks related to memory management, file systems, and operating system concepts.  
- **Lab Activities:** Hands-on labs that reinforce understanding of OS components, distributed systems, and security practices.  
- **Projects:** Larger projects demonstrating the application of system design, architecture analysis, and software development best practices, including Project Two: *Draw It or Lose It*.

## Reflection

### Transferable Skills
Through this course, I strengthened my problem-solving and analytical skills, applied concepts from system architectures to real-world problems, and learned to design maintainable, secure software across multiple platforms.

### Code Maintainability and Readability
I focus on writing clean, well-organized code with consistent formatting, clear variable names, and helpful comments. Structuring logic into classes and functions keeps code maintainable and easy to expand or update in the future.

### Project Two – Draw It or Lose It Reflection
- **Design Document:** [CS 230 Project Software Design Template 3]  
- **Client:** *The Gaming Room* requested a multi-user web-based game application that allows players to create games, join teams, and play collaboratively across multiple platforms.  
- **Strengths:** I carefully documented the software design, including UML diagrams, design patterns (Singleton and Iterator), and system architecture views. This documentation clearly communicates the structure and reasoning behind each design decision.  
- **Helpful Aspects:** Working through the design document before coding helped me understand memory management, system scalability, and platform compatibility, making the implementation more efficient and reducing errors.  
- **Areas for Improvement:** I would enhance the evaluation section with more examples of how the system could scale under heavy load and include performance benchmarks.  
- **Interpreting User Needs:** The software design reflected the user’s requirements by ensuring multi-platform compatibility, data integrity, and secure multi-user management. Considering user needs was critical for creating a solution that is reliable, maintainable, and practical.  
- **Design Approach:** I broke down the system into core components—GameService, Game, Team, Player—and applied object-oriented principles and design patterns to manage complexity. In future projects, I would continue using structured design documents and diagrams to guide development and validate architectural decisions early.

This portfolio showcases my progress and learning in CS 230: Operating Platforms and will continue to be updated with reflections, documentation, and additional projects as I complete each assignment.
