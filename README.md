# Welcome to my CS 230 portfolio!

This repository contains my coursework and projects from the CS 230 Operating Platforms class.

---

## About This Course
CS 230 focuses on understanding operating systems, system architectures, memory and storage management, and distributed systems. Throughout the course, I have completed assignments, labs, and projects to strengthen my skills in analyzing and designing software for different operating platforms.

---

## Repository Contents
- **Assignments:** Exercises and tasks related to memory management, file systems, and operating system concepts.  
- **Lab Activities:** Hands-on labs that reinforce understanding of OS components, distributed systems, and security practices.  
- **Projects:** Larger projects demonstrating the application of system design, architecture analysis, and software development best practices.

## Reflection
### Transferable Skills
Through this course, I have strengthened my problem-solving and analytical skills, applied concepts from system architectures to real-world problems, and learned to design maintainable, secure software across multiple platforms.

### Code Maintainability and Readability
I focus on writing clean, well-organized code with consistent formatting, clear variable names, and helpful comments. Structuring logic into classes and functions helps keep code maintainable and easy to expand or update in the future.
